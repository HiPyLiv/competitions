# Win a personalised HiPy T-Shirt!

The file "registration_dat.csv" contains annonymised registration data for the 1 Nov Hello Python @ FACT event.

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to use Python to generate some aweful looking plots to display this data in a sensible way. The first person to submit a working script/notebook that can do this via a GitHub pull request to this repo will win a highly coveted, personalised HiPy T-Shirt.

Good Luck.

Rob and the Beekeepers.
